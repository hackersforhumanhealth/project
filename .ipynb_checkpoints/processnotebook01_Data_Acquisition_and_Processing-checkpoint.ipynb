    "##Motivation\n",
    "------\n",
    "We are a team with diverse backgrounds in statistics, computer science, public health and biomedical research. The motivation for this project is our common interest in applying social media and data science approaches to studying and promoting human health. The scientific goal of this work was to measure average happiness state-by state using sentiment analysis of Twitter data and then to determine how well the happiness of a state correlates with public health statistics such as morbidity, mortality, healthcare quality and other criteria.\n",

    "##Overview\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often stated that health and happiness are closely linked. Quantifiable evidence to that effect is however hard to come by.  One of many reasons for this is that happiness is an ambiguous concept -- easy to recognize in oneself but often harder to detect, much less measure, in others.  Yet, if there was ever an opportune time to make a reasonable attempt at quantifying happiness in the population, it is now.  The rapid worldwide adoption of social media platforms in recent years has tremendously increased the amount, spontaneity and frequency of human communication.   Twitter usage alone [grew six orders of magnitude](http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/) from 5,000 tweets per day in 2007 to 500,000,000 tweets per day in 2013. And because social media communication is recorded electronically, it has persistence - a very attractive edge over verbal communication for a data scientist.  It is remains accessible to be parsed and analyzed as new methods and expertise become available even long after the data was generated.  Studies have shown that self-disclosure in online communication is [more frequent and revealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-disclosure) than face-to-face communication, presumably due to anonymity and physical distance.  Together, all these factors translate into the availability of huge volumes of data to work with in trying to gauge a phenomenon as nebulous as happiness.  A number of researchers have taken advantage of these characteristics of modern online communication and sought to measure happiness using twitter data. A notable example is the [hedonometer project by Dods *et al*](http://hedonometer.org/index.html), which attempts to measure the happiness of populations in real time. Recent hedonometer results reveal a clear spike in average happiness on United States Thanks Giving day and sharp dips that coincide with the recent terrorist shootings in Paris and San Bernardino.  Christmas Day consistently ranks as the happiest day of the year. Amusingly, the arrest of Justin Bieber in January 2014 was a pretty sad day; a testament to the the demographics of twitter users, or perhaps an indication of the the power of \"beliebers\" and the pandemic nature of \"bieber fever\".  A similar study by [Alex Davies](http://alex-davies-4lq6.squarespace.com/twitter-emoticon-meanings/gauged) sought to gauge the happiness of populations by performing sentiment analysis based on emoticons embedded in twitter messages. The study concluded that [Germans are the happiest](http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/germans-top-table-of-happiest-tweets) people on earth followed by Mexicans and residents of the USA.  We leveraged the experiences published by these and other researches to inform our approach in this project. Being able to reliably measure happiness opens the door to examining what the determinants of happiness in the human population are. For the current study, we chose to focus on the United States because of the ready availability of both tweet and health data for the US as well as the limitation of time and computational resources available for the project. In particular we were interested in investigating whether public health indicators released in various government and non-profit organization reports have any relationship with happiness as measured from tweets. The health data we relied on was obtained from the [American Health Rankings](http://www.americashealthrankings.org) annual report for 2014 produced by the [United Health Foundation](http://www.unitedhealthfoundation.org). The report presents a state-by-state health analysis and considers infant mortality, cancer incidences and cardiovascular deaths amongst many other factors.  \n",

    "##The question\n",
    "------\n",
    "The main question we wanted to answer is: \"Do do healthier states experience more happiness\"? To do this, we assumed that happiness as expressed in twitter communication is a surrogate for genuine happiness in the human population.  That of course is a major assumption but we felt that it is a reasonable one and that it offers as good a starting point as one can get in an effort to investigate this challenging question.  Over the course of the project, we found that, in addition to disease incidence related health statistics, the American Health Rankings annual report also considered various interesting socioeconomic and environmental parameters for each state. Some of these factors include Median Household Income, Violent Crime rates Air pollution and High School Graduation rates. We decided to modify our question to include an analysis of these factors' correlation with happiness.  "

The public streaming API that we used is [rate-limited](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) and caped to a small randomly sampled fraction of the total number of tweets available at any given moment in time.  Consequently, our data acquisition script needed to be run multiple times over several days to acquire sufficient data for analysis.  Because we did not have much time to collect data in this way, we had to resort to our backup data set from onemilliontweetmap.com. \n"
