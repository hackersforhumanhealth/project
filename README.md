## Description
It is believed that happier people live longer healthier lives. However, the link between health and positive emotions has been a difficult one to prove. Most of the existing evidence is anecdotal. One of the biggest challenges towards studying such a link is the difficulty in measuring happiness. The scientific goal of this project is to come up with a way to measure average happiness state-by state using sentiment analysis of Twitter data and then to determine how well the happiness of a state correlates with public health statistics such as morbidity, mortality, healthcare quality and other criteria.
